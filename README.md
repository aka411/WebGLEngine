# WebGL2 3D Game Engine built from scratch
This is a custom 3D game engine that i having been writing in pure JavaScript using WebGL2 API without using any libraries.

Entity–component–system (ECS) architectural design pattern is used in designing the game engine.
It also features a custom written physics engine for handling object collision and response.Below you can see a demo scene from the engine.The camera rotation is done using quaternions.

## Features
- A geometry generator for generating sphere and plane geometries.
- A collision engine for detecting sphere-sphere and sphere-plane collisions.
- A perspective and orthographic camera that can be rotated using mouse and moved by using arrow keys of the keyboard.
